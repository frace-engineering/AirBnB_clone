Steps
You won’t build this application all at once, but step by step.

Each step will link to a concept:

The console
create your data model
manage (create, update, destroy, etc) objects via a console / command interpreter
store and persist objects to a file (JSON file)
The first piece is to manipulate a powerful storage system. This storage engine will give us an abstraction between “My object” and “How they are stored and persisted”. This means: from your console code (the command interpreter itself) and from the front-end and RestAPI you will build later, you won’t have to pay attention (take care) of how your objects are stored.

This abstraction will also allow you to change the type of storage easily without updating all of your codebase.

The console will be a tool to validate this storage engine



Web static
learn HTML/CSS
create the HTML of your application
create template of each object


MySQL storage
replace the file storage by a Database storage
map your models to a table in database by using an O.R.M.


Web framework - templating
create your first web server in Python
make your static HTML file dynamic by using objects stored in a file or database


RESTful API
expose all your objects stored via a JSON web interface
manipulate your objects via a RESTful API


Web dynamic
learn JQuery
load objects from the client side by using your own RESTful API


Files and Directories
models directory will contain all classes used for the entire project. A class, called “model” in a OOP project is the representation of an object/instance.
tests directory will contain all unit tests.
console.py file is the entry point of our command interpreter.
models/base_model.py file is the base class of all our models. It contains common elements:
attributes: id, created_at and updated_at
methods: save() and to_json()
models/engine directory will contain all storage classes (using the same prototype). For the moment you will have only one: file_storage.py.
Storage
Persistency is really important for a web application. It means: every time your program is executed, it starts with all objects previously created from another execution. Without persistency, all the work done in a previous execution won’t be saved and will be gone.

In this project, you will manipulate 2 types of storage: file and database. For the moment, you will focus on file.

Why separate “storage management” from “model”? It’s to make your models modular and independent. With this architecture, you can easily replace your storage system without re-coding everything everywhere.

You will always use class attributes for any object. Why not instance attributes? For 3 reasons:

Provide easy class description: everybody will be able to see quickly what a model should contain (which attributes, etc…)
Provide default value of any attribute
In the future, provide the same model behavior for file storage or database storage
How can I store my instances?
That’s a good question. So let’s take a look at this code:

class Student():
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

students = []
s = Student("John")
students.append(s)
Here, I’m creating a student and store it in a list. But after this program execution, my Student instance doesn’t exist anymore.

class Student():
    def __init__(self, name):
        self.name = name

students = reload() # recreate the list of Student objects from a file
s = Student("John")
students.append(s)
save(students) # save all Student objects to a file
Nice!

But how it works?

First, let’s look at save(students):

Can I write each Student object to a file => NO, it will be the memory representation of the object. For another program execution, this memory representation can’t be reloaded.
Can I write each Student.name to a file => YES, but imagine you have other attributes to describe Student? It would start to be become too complex.
The best solution is to convert this list of Student objects to a JSON representation.

Why JSON? Because it’s a standard representation of object. It allows us to share this data with other developers, be human readable, but mainly to be understood by another language/program.

Example:

My Python program creates Student objects and saves them to a JSON file
Another Javascript program can read this JSON file and manipulate its own Student class/representation
And the reload()? now you know the file is a JSON file representing all Student objects. So reload() has to read the file, parse the JSON string, and re-create Student objects based on this data-structure.

File storage == JSON serialization
For this first step, you have to write in a file all your objects/instances created/updated in your command interpreter and restore them when you start it. You can’t store and restore a Python instance of a class as “Bytes”, the only way is to convert it to a serializable data structure:

convert an instance to Python built in serializable data structure (list, dict, number and string) - for us it will be the method my_instance.to_json() to retrieve a dictionary
convert this data structure to a string (JSON format, but it can be YAML, XML, CSV…) - for us it will be a my_string = JSON.dumps(my_dict)
write this string to a file on disk
And the process of deserialization?

The same but in the other way:

read a string from a file on disk
convert this string to a data structure. This string is a JSON representation, so it’s easy to convert - for us it will be a my_dict = JSON.loads(my_string)
convert this data structure to instance - for us it will be a my_instance = MyObject(my_dict)
*args, **kwargs
How To Use them

How do you pass arguments to a function?

def my_fct(param_1, param_2):
    ...

my_fct("Best", "School")
But with this function definition, you must call my_fct with 2 parameters, no more, no less.

Can it be dynamic? Yes you can:

def my_fct(*args, **kwargs):
    ...

my_fct("Best", "School")
What? What’s *args and **kwargs?

*args is a Tuple that contains all arguments
*kwargs is a dictionary that contains all arguments by key/value
A dictionary? But why?

So, to make it clear, *args is the list of anonymous arguments, no name, just an order. **kwargs is the dictionary with all named arguments.

Examples:

def my_fct(*args, **kwargs):
    print("{} - {}".format(args, kwargs))

my_fct() # () - {}
my_fct("Best") # ('Best',) - {}
my_fct("Best", 89) # ('Best', 89) - {}
my_fct(name="Best") # () - {'name': 'Best'}
my_fct(name="Best", number=89) # () - {'name': 'Best', 'number': 89}
my_fct("School", 12, name="Best", number=89) # ('School', 12) - {'name': 'Best', 'number': 89}
Perfect? Ofmorrow) # 2017-06-09 20:42:42.170922
… you can also store it:

a_dict = { 'my_date': date_now }
print(type(a_dict['my_date'])) # <class 'datetime.datetime'>
print(a_dict) # {'my_date': datetime.datetime(2017, 6, 8, 20, 42, 42, 170922)}
What? What’s this format when a datetime instance is in a datastructure??? It’s unreadable.

How to make it readable: strftime

print(date_now.strftime("%A")) # Thursday
print(date_now.strftime("%A %d %B %Y at %H:%M:%S")) # Thursday 08 June 2017 at 20:42:42
Data diagram


 course you can mix both, but the order should be first all anonymous arguments, and after named arguments.

Last example:

def my_fct(*args, **kwargs):
    print("{} - {}".format(args, kwargs))

a_dict = { 'name': "Best", 'age': 89 }

my_fct(a_dict) # ({'age': 89, 'name': 'Best'},) - {}
my_fct(*a_dict) # ('age', 'name') - {}
my_fct(**a_dict) # () - {'age': 89, 'name': 'Best'}
You can play with these 2 arguments to clearly understand where and how your variables are stored.

datetime
datetime is a Python module to manipulate date, time etc.

In this example, you create an instance of datetime with the current date and time:

from datetime import datetime

date_now = datetime.now()
print(type(date_now)) # <class 'datetime.datetime'>
print(date_now) # 2017-06-08 20:42:42.170922
date_now is an object, so you can manipulate it:

from datetime import timedelta

date_tomorrow = date_now + timedelta(days=1)
print(date_to

  Task 3.  BaseModel

Write a class BaseModel that defines all common attributes/methods for other classes:

models/base_model.py
Public instance attributes:
id: string - assign with an uuid when an instance is created:
you can use uuid.uuid4() to generate unique id but don’t forget to convert to a string
the goal is to have unique id for each BaseModel
created_at: datetime - assign with the current datetime when an instance is created
updated_at: datetime - assign with the current datetime when an instance is created and it will be updated every time you change your object
__str__: should print: [<class name>] (<self.id>) <self.__dict__>
Public instance methods:
save(self): updates the public instance attribute updated_at with the current datetime
to_dict(self): returns a dictionary containing all keys/values of __dict__ of the instance:
by using self.__dict__, only instance attributes set will be returned
a key __class__ must be added to this dictionary with the class name of the object
created_at and updated_at must be converted to string object in ISO format:
format: %Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S.%f (ex: 2017-06-14T22:31:03.285259)
you can use isoformat() of datetime object
This method will be the first piece of the serialization/deserialization process: create a dictionary representation with “simple object type” of our BaseModel

   Task 4.  Create BaseModel from dictionary.

Previously we created a method to generate a dictionary representation of an instance (method to_dict()).

Now it’s time to re-create an instance with this dictionary representation.

<class 'BaseModel'> -> to_dict() -> <class 'dict'> -> <class 'BaseModel'>
Update models/base_model.py:

__init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
you will use *args, **kwargs arguments for the constructor of a BaseModel. (more information inside the AirBnB clone concept page)
*args won’t be used
if kwargs is not empty:
each key of this dictionary is an attribute name (Note __class__ from kwargs is the only one that should not be added as an attribute. See the example output, below)
each value of this dictionary is the value of this attribute name
Warning: created_at and updated_at are strings in this dictionary, but inside your BaseModel instance is working with datetime object. You have to convert these strings into datetime object. Tip: you know the string format of these datetime
otherwise:
create id and created_at as you did previously (new instance)

  Task 5. Store first Object.

Now we can recreate a BaseModel from another one by using a dictionary representation:

<class 'BaseModel'> -> to_dict() -> <class 'dict'> -> <class 'BaseModel'>
It’s great but it’s still not persistent: every time you launch the program, you don’t restore all objects created before… The first way you will see here is to save these objects to a file.

Writing the dictionary representation to a file won’t be relevant:

Python doesn’t know how to convert a string to a dictionary (easily)
It’s not human readable
Using this file with another program in Python or other language will be hard.
So, you will convert the dictionary representation to a JSON string. JSON is a standard representation of a data structure. With this format, humans can read and all programming languages have a JSON reader and writer.

Now the flow of serialization-deserialization will be:

<class 'BaseModel'> -> to_dict() -> <class 'dict'> -> JSON dump -> <class 'str'> -> FILE -> <class 'str'> -> JSON load -> <class 'dict'> -> <class 'BaseModel'>
Magic right?

Terms:

simple Python data structure: Dictionaries, arrays, number and string. ex: { '12': { 'numbers': [1, 2, 3], 'name': "John" } }
JSON string representation: String representing a simple data structure in JSON format. ex: '{ "12": { "numbers": [1, 2, 3], "name": "John" } }'
Write a class FileStorage that serializes instances to a JSON file and deserializes JSON file to instances:

models/engine/file_storage.py
Private class attributes:
__file_path: string - path to the JSON file (ex: file.json)
__objects: dictionary - empty but will store all objects by <class name>.id (ex: to store a BaseModel object with id=12121212, the key will be BaseModel.12121212)
Public instance methods:
all(self): returns the dictionary __objects
new(self, obj): sets in __objects the obj with key <obj class name>.id
save(self): serializes __objects to the JSON file (path: __file_path)
reload(self): deserializes the JSON file to __objects (only if the JSON file (__file_path) exists ; otherwise, do nothing. If the file doesn’t exist, no exception should be raised)
Update models/__init__.py: to create a unique FileStorage instance for your application

import file_storage.py
create the variable storage, an instance of FileStorage
call reload() method on this variable
Update models/base_model.py: to link your BaseModel to FileStorage by using the variable storage

import the variable storage
in the method save(self):
call save(self) method of storage
__init__(self, *args, **kwargs):
if it’s a new instance (not from a dictionary representation), add a call to the method new(self) on storage

  Task 6.

Write a program called console.py that contains the entry point of the command interpreter:

You must use the module cmd
Your class definition must be: class HBNBCommand(cmd.Cmd):
Your command interpreter should implement:
quit and EOF to exit the program
help (this action is provided by default by cmd but you should keep it updated and documented as you work through tasks)
a custom prompt: (hbnb)
an empty line + ENTER shouldn’t execute anything
Your code should not be executed when imported
Warning:

You should end your file with:

if __name__ == '__main__':
    HBNBCommand().cmdloop()
to make your program executable except when imported. Please don’t add anything around - the Checker won’t like it otherwise

Update your command interpreter (console.py) to have these commands:

create: Creates a new instance of BaseModel, saves it (to the JSON file) and prints the id. Ex: $ create BaseModel
If the class name is missing, print ** class name missing ** (ex: $ create)
If the class name doesn’t exist, print ** class doesn't exist ** (ex: $ create MyModel)
show: Prints the string representation of an instance based on the class name and id. Ex: $ show BaseModel 1234-1234-1234.
If the class name is missing, print ** class name missing ** (ex: $ show)
If the class name doesn’t exist, print ** class doesn't exist ** (ex: $ show MyModel)
If the id is missing, print ** instance id missing ** (ex: $ show BaseModel)
If the instance of the class name doesn’t exist for the id, print ** no instance found ** (ex: $ show BaseModel 121212)
destroy: Deletes an instance based on the class name and id (save the change into the JSON file). Ex: $ destroy BaseModel 1234-1234-1234.
If the class name is missing, print ** class name missing ** (ex: $ destroy)
If the class name doesn’t exist, print ** class doesn't exist ** (ex:$ destroy MyModel)
If the id is missing, print ** instance id missing ** (ex: $ destroy BaseModel)
If the instance of the class name doesn’t exist for the id, print ** no instance found ** (ex: $ destroy BaseModel 121212)
all: Prints all string representation of all instances based or not on the class name. Ex: $ all BaseModel or $ all.
The printed result must be a list of strings (like the example below)
If the class name doesn’t exist, print ** class doesn't exist ** (ex: $ all MyModel)
update: Updates an instance based on the class name and id by adding or updating attribute (save the change into the JSON file). Ex: $ update BaseModel 1234-1234-1234 email "aibnb@mail.com".
Usage: update <class name> <id> <attribute name> "<attribute value>"
Only one attribute can be updated at the time
You can assume the attribute name is valid (exists for this model)
The attribute value must be casted to the attribute type
If the class name is missing, print ** class name missing ** (ex: $ update)
If the class name doesn’t exist, print ** class doesn't exist ** (ex: $ update MyModel)
If the id is missing, print ** instance id missing ** (ex: $ update BaseModel)
If the instance of the class name doesn’t exist for the id, print ** no instance found ** (ex: $ update BaseModel 121212)
If the attribute name is missing, print ** attribute name missing ** (ex: $ update BaseModel existing-id)
If the value for the attribute name doesn’t exist, print ** value missing ** (ex: $ update BaseModel existing-id first_name)
All other arguments should not be used (Ex: $ update BaseModel 1234-1234-1234 email "aibnb@mail.com" first_name "Betty" = $ update BaseModel 1234-1234-1234 email "aibnb@mail.com")
id, created_at and updated_at cant’ be updated. You can assume they won’t be passed in the update command
Only “simple” arguments can be updated: string, integer and float. You can assume nobody will try to update list of ids or datetime
Let’s add some rules:

You can assume arguments are always in the right order
Each arguments are separated by a space
A string argument with a space must be between double quote
The error management starts from the first argument to the last one

Task 8.

Write a class User that inherits from BaseModel:

models/user.py
Public class attributes:
email: string - empty string
password: string - empty string
first_name: string - empty string
last_name: string - empty string
Update FileStorage to manage correctly serialization and deserialization of User.

Update your command interpreter (console.py) to allow show, create, destroy, update and all used with User.

  Task 9.

Write all those classes that inherit from BaseModel:

State (models/state.py):
Public class attributes:
name: string - empty string
City (models/city.py):
Public class attributes:
state_id: string - empty string: it will be the State.id
name: string - empty string
Amenity (models/amenity.py):
Public class attributes:
name: string - empty string
Place (models/place.py):
Public class attributes:
city_id: string - empty string: it will be the City.id
user_id: string - empty string: it will be the User.id
name: string - empty string
description: string - empty string
number_rooms: integer - 0
number_bathrooms: integer - 0
max_guest: integer - 0
price_by_night: integer - 0
latitude: float - 0.0
longitude: float - 0.0
amenity_ids: list of string - empty list: it will be the list of Amenity.id later
Review (models/review.py):
Public class attributes:
place_id: string - empty string: it will be the Place.id
user_id: string - empty string: it will be the User.id
text: string - empty string

  Task 10.

Update FileStorage to manage correctly serialization and deserialization of all our new classes: Place, State, City, Amenity and Review

Update your command interpreter (console.py) to allow those actions: show, create, destroy, update and all with all classes created previously.

Enjoy your first console!

No unittests needed for the console
